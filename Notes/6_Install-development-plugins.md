# 6. Install some development related plugins and themes.

## WordPress plugins
There a number of useful plugins that you might need.
Consult the WordPress documentation or explore in your WP instance's dashboard the "Plugins" tool in the sidebar.  It contains a vast array of plugins and makes it really easy to install and activate them.  Be a bit skeptical of them as presented.  Sometimes there are many similar but some are good and some are not.  Read the reviews and star ratings.   Here are some that I use and recommend: 

### Classic Editor
is a simple one that gives you the option when editing pages and posts of choosing whether you use the modern block editor, or the older but still useful classic editor.   

### Ultimate Markdown
[UMD](https://daext.com/ultimate-markdown/) is a cool but somewhat quirky plugin that lets you import .md files and convert them to WP pages and posts. It also allows you to export your otherwise written pages and posts to roughly equivalent .md files. I'm exploring that currently and will refer to this in a future step. 

### Anti-Spam by CleanTalk
[Anti-Spam](https://cleantalk.org) is a service that has plugins to WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal content management systems.   I use this for my MichaelKentBurns.com training site.  It intercepts comments from readers, and other login attemts and analyzes them.  I installed this because I was getting many random spam comments, and even intrusion attempts.  I'm talking 20 or more a week that I was having to accept or reject manually.   

### PHP compatibility checker
[See this page:](https://wordpress.org/plugins/php-compatibility-checker/)
WordPress sites obviously require the use of PHP, and PHP comes in many versions.  WordPress itself, and many themes and plugins have specific requirements on the version of PHP you have installed.  When you are using an older version and WP itself or one of your plugins requires a newer version, your dashboard will tell you that you need to upgrade.  But, don't instantly go out and install the latest greatest, because some of your plugins may not yet be compatible.   This plugin will scan all of your themes and plugins and give you a report of which versions of PHP they are or are not compatible with.  Once you check the report you will know which is the most recent version that is compatible with your WP site.
