# RDwordpress - A WordPress installation project for Research and Development.
Note: Hereafter I will use the abbreviation **WP** instead of WordPress. 

## Purpose:  
A project to learn how to install and administer WP instances and do  development research to understand how WP works.

* It is expected that the student will create their own empty repository and follow the instructions herein to create their own copy. 
* It is very reasonable that a student would clone this project as an example so that they can compare their results with mine. 
* The reason I recommend doing this on your own development machine is to make the installing, programming and debuging process easier.
* It can be done on a remote server but that requires skills and tools not covered by this project.

## Methods:

## Notes: 
There is a **Notes** directory at the top of the project directory in which I keep various notes of instruction, things I have learned, and questions I have.

## Issues: 
The GitHub **Issues** for this repository will contain instructions for steps in the process, and errors or suggestions for improving, as well as problems encountered by students.

## Process: 
The basic steps used in developing this, and to be used by students. 
This is just the README overview so you can understand the big picture.
So, please read this fully before proceeding.
- Each of these steps has it's own .md file in the Notes directory.  
- When you are ready to begin that step open that steps .md file for detailed instructions.  
- Also, each step has an Issue already created in my repository.
It will have a link to the appropriate .md file for your convenience. 
- As you work on that step and have questions or corrections or OS specific differences, please leave comments in the Issue.  I will try to follow those comments and reply.  I may use those comments to make updates to the .md file.
- When you complete that step leave a final comment on it's Issue so I know you have finished. 
- I hope this somewhat complex process will allow all of us to learn together and improve this repository for future learners. 

### 1. Find or install a LAMPP, WAMPP, or XAMPP stack.  (XAMPP is my recommendation because it works on Windows, Linux, and Mac)
- However this can also be done with any Web server (Apache, NGINX) as long as you also have PHP, MySQL and JavaScript.

### 2. Into that stack, install a fresh WordPress instance.

### 3. Make that instance also a new Git repository and add that to GitHub.

### 4. Get tools that can dump the WP SQL database files to text files for git tracking.

### 5. Setup VS Code or equivalent set of Web development IDE or command line tools.

### 6. Install some development related WordPress plugins and themes.

### 7.
